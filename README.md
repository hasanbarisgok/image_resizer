# Streamlit Image Resizer
This is a simple image resizing application built using Streamlit and PIL (Python Imaging Library) that allows users to upload images and resize them by specifying the desired width and height.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, you will need to install Streamlit and PIL. You can do this by running the following commands:

```
pip install streamlit
pip install pillow
```


Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the application by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and running the following command:

```
streamlit run image_resizer.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

To use the application, simply click on the "Browse files" button and select one or more images that you would like to resize. Once you have selected your images, enter the desired width and height values in the corresponding input boxes, and click on the "Resize Images" button to resize your images.

The resized images will be saved in a new folder called "resized_images" in the project directory.
